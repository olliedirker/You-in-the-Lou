# You in The Lou

## User Story

As a transplant to St. Louis, or a tourist, or a local looking to find more to love about my city; I want to be able to look up local events posted by locals. I would also like these posts to have a social media feel to them so I can interact with other users and make new friends along the way!

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that I am searching for St. Louis area events and a social media website,

WHEN I view the homepage, THEN I can see a list of posts (shown in most recent order) with an event title, url, address, and description that I can view.

WHEN I go to the login page, THEN I can sign up to use the site by giving a username, email address, and password.

WHEN I have signed up, then I can login and logout anytime by hitting the relevant buttons in the header of the page.

WHEN I sign in, I am automatically redirected to the dashboard page where I can create my own posts or edit ones (by title, address, or description) that I've already made.

WHEN I go back to the homepage after logging in, THEN I can comment and like other posts as a way to interact with other users. I can also comment on my own posts to respond to users from there.
